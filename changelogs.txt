--1.12.BETA_3/BETA_4--

BETA_5: Fix: Skin assets would be unable to extract.
BETA_4: Fix: On start, while creating the TradesGUI, switching windows would cause a message box. (Only happens with Mode: Overlay)

Features:
- Tabs notifications:
When your buyer joins your area, the tab colour will turn to green. The colour will revert back to normal when the buyer leaves the area.
When receiving another whisper from a buyer, the tab colour will turn to purple. The colour will revert back to normal when you acknowledged the whisper by hovering the "Other:" slot for that tab.
These options cannot be disabled at the moment, but full 1.12 release will allow to do so as well as playing a custom sound.

Changes:
- The About GUI now shows both current Beta and Stable version numbers.

Fixes:

- When using the "Mode: Overlay", upon activating another window, the Trades GUI position would not be automatically adjusted.
- When using a non-default Screen DPI, the Trades GUI background picture would not fill the entire size.
- When using a non-default Screen DPI, the tray notifications would appear cut-off.
- Auto Updater: When running the source code (.ahk), the POE Trades Companion.ahk file would get deleted upon updating using the internal updater.

--1.12.BETA_1--
Skinning is now easier than ever.
If you are interested into making your own skin, visit here:
github.com/lemasato/POE-Trades-Companion/wiki/Creating-Your-Skin

What's new:

This tab would no longer appear since 1.10. Additionally, stats from this tab will not be saved.

//
\\
--1.11--

- Clicking on a tray notification to close it would only work on parts with text. You can now click anywhere in the notification to close it.
- "jeweller" and "chromatic" currencies from poe.trade would not be recognized. This is because poe.trade and currency.poe.trade uses different names for these currencies.
//
\\

//
\\
--1.10--
What's new:
- The "Mark trade as completed?" feature has been added, and its setting renamed to "Save the trade infos into a file?"
You can find the file containing all logged trades in MyDocuments\AutoHotkey\POE Trades Companion\Trades_History.ini
- A new Hotkeys sub-tab: Special. These allows you to bind the following actions:
Choosing the next tab / Choosing the previous tab / Closing the current tab / Toggling the minimize state.
- Five new smaller buttons that have a specific action: Clipboard / Whisper To / Invite / Trade / Kick.
These buttons use a special font that contains symbols corresponding to the button's purpose.
Each can be linked to an hotkey via the new tab: Smaller Buttons.
- The /NoAdmin Command-Line Parameter can be used to skip admin elevation.
- You can now set the font's quality from the Appearance tab. This allows fixing the issue with the Fontin SmallCaps font, where some characters would appear cropped.

 
What's changed:
- Many visual changes in the Settings.
- The "Update available" GUI has been replaced with the About GUI, and the About GUI has received some visual improvements.
- The "Reloading as admin in X seconds" splash screen has been replaced with a proper GUI.
- The minimized state of the main interface now also include the bottom border.
- The Settings tab "Buttons Actions" has been renamed to "Custom Buttons"
- Basic and Advanced Hotkeys now have their own specific tab, and can be used together.
For this reason, if you had the Basic mode enabled, all Advanced hotkeys have been toggled off (and vice-versa).
The CTRL/ALT/SHIFT toggles from the Basic mode have been removed (it is now handled by the hotkey control itself), and two more hotkeys have been added.
- The "Close" asset from the Path of Exile skin has been resized to 20x20 (from 25x25).
- Changing a Custom Button's name in the Settings now also live-update the button's name on the main interface.
- It now takes only one admin elevation failed attempt (from two) before offering the user the possibility to run without elevation.
A proper GUI has been created (previously it was a simple message box).
Additionally, a shortcut with the /NoAdmin Command-Line Parameter will be automatically added to the executable's folder.
- The title on the main interface would not be vertically centered (OCD TRIGGERS). The same is true for the "MINIMIZE" text.

What's fixed:
- Receiving a whisper with the "Trade Notification" sound toggle disabled, but with the "Whisper Notification" sound toggle enabled would not play the "Whisper Notification" sound.
- An issue with the Path of Exile skin where hovering a Custom Button would not highlight the picture under specific conditions.
- Changing a Custom Button's name in the Settings would no longer live-update the button's name on the Settings GUI (since 1.9.5)
- When receiving a new trade whisper without additional message, the "Other:" slot is set as "-".
Upon receiving another whisper from the same buyer, when hovering the "Other:" slot to see the full list of messages, the "-" would be included to the messages list.
- Some characters on the Fontin SmallCaps font would appear cropped. This has been fixed with the new addition of the "Font Quality" setting.
- With the Font Size set to "Automatic", upon choosing a font from the Appearance tab, the size number would not be updated to its default value. This could cause confusion for the user.
//
\\
--1.9.9--
- Fix: Custom Buttons hotkeys would only work while the cursor was on the main interface.
- Potential Fix: On launch, under specific conditions, the main interface's position would be reverted to default (top-right).
//
\\
--1.9.8--

- Fix: Hotkeys: Hotkey and text being saved as Advanced Hotkeys instead of regular hotkeys.
//

- Improved the "Clipboard Item" function. Making use of quotes and search tags, it allows a more precise item search.
- The main interface's position is now also saved after moving the window. Previously, it would only save the position upon reloading or closing the tool from its tray menu. This fixes an issue where killing the process would not save the interface's position.
- Fix: Run as admin: The local files would be stored in the admin's My Documents folder instead of the current user's My Documents. This would prevent the tool from reading the chat key from the game's config file.
- Fix: System Theme: Font size, when on automatic mode, would not use the default system's font size.
- Potential Fix: The transparency/click-through/auto-unminimize settings would sometimes not work correctly for some users.
//
\\
--v1.9.4--
- Enabling the "Overlay" mode will reset the last registered position to the top right of the monitor. This fixes a behaviour where the main interface would be stuck offscreen.
- Messages are no longer sent if the chat key is invalid (thus opening random panels, using skills/flasks).
- Fix: Messages ending with a space would not take the space in consideration when sending it in-game. For this change to take place, you will be required to open then close  [Settings] tray menu after updating.
//
\\
--v1.9.3--
- Fix: Using an hotkey would bring up the "replace PID" prompt.
//
\\
--v1.9.1--
- Added the button action "Write Message". Allows you to write a single message without sending it.
- Fixed an issue where the tool would be unable to retrieve the game's key used to open the chat if the "My Documents" folder was not in the userprofile folder.
//
\\
--v1.9--

- The way messages are handled has been reworked. You can set up to three messages for a specific button. Also, the key used to open the chat no longer defaults to ENTER: It is now automatically the same key you have set in-game. For this reason, Basic and Advanced messages have been removed.  

About:  
- Only the changelogs are being shown, and the window has been made bigger.  
- The donating button has been re-introduced (ifeelbadaboutthis).  


What's fixed:  
- Several things about the main interface.  
- Clicking on "Switch to Basic/Advanced" in the hotkeys tab would not re-select the hotkeys tab after re-creating the Settings GUI.

What's new:  
- Brand new PoE themed skin!  
- TradesGUI: Receiving a whisper from someone who is on your trades queue will add that whisper to the Other section.  
- TradesGUI: Receiving multiple times the same poe.trade whisper from someone (therefore making an unwanted duplicate) will no longer add that trade to the queue.  
- TradesGUI: Upon closing a tab, if other tabs contain exactly the same infos (Item+Price+Location), you can choose to automatically close those tabs aswell.  
- TradesGUI: Hovering the content of a Buyer/Item/Price/Location/Other slot now shows a tooltip containing the full text. This is so the user can still see the full slot's content if the text is being cut.

What's fixed:  
- Quality gem of 10% or 20% now show up correctly, just like prior to version 1.7.4.  
- Clicking on a custom button with the "Close Tab" option while no POE instances were running would wrongfully close the currently active tab after a few seconds.

//
\\
--v1.7--
What's new:  
- The Trades GUI has been completely re-worked. It now has a brand new custom title bar and a new function that allows you to minimize the GUI! Additionally, the title will turn yellow while trades are on queue.  
- Trades GUI now has a new "Other:" section. It contains anything that could have been added before and after the trade message, allowing you to see if, for example, the buyer added his offer after the regular trade message.  
- Trades GUI can automatically minimize itself while no trade are on queue, and un-minimize itself upon receiving a new trade request. The respective settings can be found in the [Settings] tray menu.  
- Upon receiving a new trade message, the new tab can be automatically focused by enabling the "Focus newly created tabs" in the [Settings] tray menu.  
- The variable %lastWhisper% has been added for usage in the TradesGUI/Hotkeys tab. It corresponds to the last person who whispered you.

What's changed:

- Upon closing a tab, the script no longer defaults back to the first tab.  
- Due to the Trades GUI being pre-loaded at the start of the script, any change to the Trades GUI via the TradesGUI tab in the [Settings] menu now require a reload of the script to be taken in count.  

What's fixed:  
- When the buyer added something after the trade message, the "Location:" section of the Trades GUI would pick it up.  
- The [Cycle Overlay] would sometimes require to be clicked twice before cycling to the next found instance.  
- After a game crash, the Trades GUI buttons would no longer work since they were linked to the old PID. Now, if the linked PID does not match a POE instance anymore, the user will be asked to select between the found matches.  
//

What's changed:

- The TradesGUI should no longer "run away" upon updating, when using a non-default Screen Fonts DPI.
//


\\

//

//
\\
--v1.4--
What's new:
- You can now set the transparency of the Trades GUI by going into the [Settings] tray menu.
The lowest you can go is 30%, to make sure the window is still able to be seen.
- "Dock Mode" being removed, you can now cycle the Trades GUI between the game's window by using the new [Cycle Overlay] in the tray option (Right click on the tray icon > Cycle Overlay)
- You can switch the Trades GUI between [Windowed] and [Overlay] by right clicking the tray icon and clicking on the according mode.
- If the logs file is deleted or characters/lines are being edited out, the script will restart the Logs Monitoring function to make sure it doesn't stall
(^ This kind of behaviour should not happend, I consider it as an useless measure of security but I like it "just incase")
		
What's changed:
- You do not need to reload the script after changing a setting anymore, everything is instantly applied.
- "Dock Mode" and "Logs Mode" have been removed from the [Settings] menu, as it is all automatized now.
- The Trades GUI buttons now use a much faster method of sending keyboard input.
	
What's fixed:
- Tray icons from previously replaced instances of the script will now correctly disappear if they are not hidden in the sub tray notitication.
- The script will no longer skip whispers when receving two messages at the very same time.
- The Trades GUI will no longer flicker while having the "Show in game only" setting activated.
- Enabling an hotkey without binding it to a key prior will not crash the script anymore.
- You should no longer randomly receive a tray notification of a prior whisper.
	
Troubleshooting:
- About Logs Mode and Dock Mode being removed due to automatisation:
	Logs Mode:
	- If the script detect multiple instance of the game, it will check the location of the logs file.
	- If the logs file are located in different folders, it will show a new GUI to ask which one should be used.
	This only happens once at the very start of the Logs Monitoring function. So if you run a separate instance that doesn't use the same logs file while the script is already loaded, and want to monitor that log instead, you will need to reload the script.
	
	Dock Mode:
	- You can still define the window the Trades GUI will dock on by using the new [Cycle Overlay] tray option (Right click on the tray icon > Cycle Overlay)
	
- About the new Windowed and the Overlay mode:
	Windowed:
	- In Windowed mode, you can drag around the Trades GUI. If you want to move it while it's inactive (= click-through), simply open the [Settings].
	- Having the Settings window open allows you to drag the Trades GUI even if it's inactive. Closing the Settings will effectively re-apply the click-through ability.
	Overlay:
	- In Overlay mode, the Trades GUI will appear borderless and will dock on the top right of your game's window.
	- If you are running multiple instance and the Trades GUI is docked on the wrong window, use the new [Cycle Overlay] accessible by right-clicking the tray icon.

What's new:

The Hotkeys tab allows you to set up to 6 custom hotkeys.
- Added a new button on the main GUI : "Item Sold"

You can, as always, customize the message being sent by going into in the Settings > Messages tab
- The game's taskbar button will now blink when a whisper is received while being tabbed out.
- The script will now try to run in admin mode if available.
If it fails to do so multiple times, it will allow you to run it wihout admin privilieges
(When running without admin privilieges, the Trades GUI buttons won't be working as the script is unable to send inputs to the game)
- A special additional message can be sent to your buyer upon clicking the "Thanks" or the new "Sold" button.
Feel free to enable it by going into the [Settings] tray menu.

What's changed:
